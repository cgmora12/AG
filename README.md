# AG: Automatic API Generator to Access & Visualize Open Data

This is an automatic API generator from open data resources.

In order to solve the problem of accessing and reusing open data, it is proposed a methodology that consists in the automatic generation of APIs, which allows a direct and simple access to data. This generation process is based on models to facilitate the comprehension, reuse and standardization of the API. Thus, from an open data source, an API and its OpenAPI interactive documentation will be generated automatically.
